Developed an alphanumeric character recognition program with the EMNIST dataset using TensorFlow. 
Enhanced the alphanumeric character recognition program into a Flask web app which accepts a user-written character on an HTML canvas and predicts the character.
HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used.

Deployed the alphanumeric character recognition web app on Google Cloud, modifying the environment (like using a specific version of tensorflow-cpu instead of the latest tensorflow) to work within the limitations of the Standard Environment of the Google App Engine.
